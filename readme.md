Question 1:
This is pretty straight forward
The C file is A.c
The makefile target A will compile an executable titled A


Question 2:
Also pretty straightforward
The C file is B.c
The makefile target B will compile an executable titled B

There are some details about the code worth mentioning...
- The mutex lock is declared globally
- The struct threadArgs contains all the input arguments needed for 
   each thread to do what it needs to do.
- There are three subroutines described in detail in the C file
- The general algorithm of the program is also explained in the C file header
- There are lots of printf() checks that are commented out
